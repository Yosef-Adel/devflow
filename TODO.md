### Medium Priority — Enhanced Features

- [ ] Xcode project detection
- [ ] Better vim/neovim/tmux detection

**Keyboard Shortcuts (power users)**

- [ ] Navigate app with keyboard

**AFK / Idle Improvements (accuracy)**

- [ ] Post-idle prompt: ask user what they were doing while away
- [ ] Let users retroactively assign idle time to a category/project
- [ ] Smarter idle merging (short idle gaps within same app don't break sessions)

**Data Retention & Cleanup (long-term users)**

- [ ] Configurable data retention policy (e.g., keep 90 days detailed, aggregate older)
- [ ] Automatic pruning of old data on schedule
- [ ] Manual "clear data older than X" option
- [ ] Database size indicator in settings

### Lower Priority — Nice to Have

**Themes & Appearance**

- [ ] Compact mode for smaller screens

**Browser Integration (requires extension development)**

- [ ] Browser extension for accurate URL/tab tracking
- [ ] Track specific tabs/pages not just domain

**App/Website Blocking (complex feature)**

- [ ] Block distracting apps/sites during focus sessions
- [ ] Configurable block list per category
- [ ] Soft block (warning notification) vs hard block (redirect/close)

**Platform**

- [ ] Linux Wayland support (when APIs become available)

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Fix drizzle.config.ts parsing error
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout
- [ ] Add loading states to all async operations
- [x] Unit tests for categorizer (99 tests)
- [ ] Unit tests for context extractor
- [ ] E2E tests for main flows
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets (pagination, virtual scrolling)
- [ ] Migrate from polling to event-driven window tracking where possible
- [ ] Type-safe IPC layer (shared types between main/preload/renderer)

## Product Vision

The app currently does **passive observation** — it shows you what happened. The path to
something people actually keep using (and eventually pay for) is:

**Observation → Insights → Behavior Change**

Each stage below builds on the previous one. Don't skip ahead.

---

## Stage 1: Insights — v1.1

> Move from "here's your data" to "here's what your data means"

### Week-over-Week Comparisons

- [ ] Compare this week vs last week for each category
- [ ] Show deltas: "+1h 20m development" / "-45m social media"
- [ ] Highlight significant changes (>20% shift) on dashboard
- [ ] "Your most productive day this week was Tuesday" type insights

### Trend Detection

- [ ] Rolling averages for productive vs unproductive time
- [ ] Detect patterns: "You're most focused between 9-11am"
- [ ] Detect anti-patterns: "Your social media usage spikes after 3pm"
- [ ] Show productive hours vs total tracked hours ratio over time

### Weekly Digest Notification

- [ ] Desktop notification every Monday morning with last week's summary
- [ ] Total productive time, top projects, biggest time sinks
- [ ] One actionable insight (e.g., "Reddit increased 40% — set a limit?")
- [ ] Configurable: which day/time to receive it
- [ ] Optional daily end-of-day summary report

### Context-Aware Dashboard

- [ ] "Right now" card: show how today compares to your average day at this hour
- [ ] "You usually spend X on development by now, you're at Y" progress indicator
- [ ] Surface the project you've spent the most time on this week prominently

---

## Stage 2: Behavior Change — v1.2

> Move from "here's what your data means" to "here's how to act on it"

### Goals

- [ ] Set daily goals per category (e.g., "4h development", "< 30m social")
- [ ] Goal progress ring/bar on dashboard (like Apple Watch activity rings)
- [ ] Weekly goal summary: how many days you hit your targets
- [ ] Streaks: "5-day streak of hitting your development goal"

### Alerts & Limits

- [ ] Set time limits per app or category
- [ ] Desktop notification when approaching limit (80% threshold)
- [ ] Desktop notification when limit exceeded
- [ ] Optional: gentle nudge ("You've been on Twitter for 30m, take a break?")

### Focus Sessions

- [x] Pomodoro timer with named sessions and activity tagging
- [ ] During focus session, flag any non-productive app switch
- [ ] Focus session report: how much of the session was actually focused
- [ ] "Deep work" auto-detection: 45+ min uninterrupted development

### Break Reminders

- [ ] Notify after X continuous minutes of work (configurable, default 90m)
- [ ] Track break frequency and duration
- [ ] Show work/break ratio in reports
- [ ] "You've been on X for Y minutes" nudge for distracting categories

---

## Stage 3: Developer Niche — v1.3

> Lean into "time tracker built for developers" as positioning

### Project-Level Analytics

- [x] User-managed projects with manual session assignment
- [x] Auto-suggestion from VS Code/GitHub context detection
- [ ] Per-project dashboard: time breakdown by file type, language, branch
- [ ] "Time to complete" estimates based on historical project data
- [ ] Project switching frequency (context switch cost visualization)

### Git Integration

- [ ] Detect current git branch from terminal/IDE
- [ ] Correlate time spent with commits (time between commits)
- [ ] Show "coding time" vs "review time" vs "debugging time" heuristics
- [ ] Link to GitHub PRs/issues from activity context

### Code Review Time

- [ ] Track time spent on GitHub PR pages
- [ ] Aggregate: "You spent 3h on code reviews this week"
- [ ] Break down by repo

### Meeting Impact

- [ ] Detect calendar apps / video calls (Zoom, Meet, Slack huddle)
- [ ] "Meeting load" metric: % of day in meetings
- [ ] Fragmentation score: how many focus blocks were interrupted by meetings
- [ ] Show meeting-free deep work windows
